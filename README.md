## Glutton Monsters

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matteocargnelutti/gluttonmonsters/master/capture.PNG)

A prototype for a HTML5 game from back in 2015, in which the player has to quickly tap on monsters of a specific color among those that appear on the screen.

The game is entirely made with HTML5 / CSS3 / JS, relying on DOM elments and CSS animations.
It is also built on mobile-first responsive design and should work pretty much everywhere.
On desktop, you can use arrows keys to play.
